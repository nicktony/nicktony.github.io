											<strong>NYC Crime Rate Forecasting w/Interactive AirBnB Map</strong>
											<a href="https://github.com/nicktony/CSE881-Final-Project" target="_blank" style="color: #8fb2eb;">(GitHub Repository)</a>
											<br>
											Developing an interactive dashboard to assist users in selecting Airbnb accommodations in New York City while forecasting future crime rates up to 30 days in advance. By integrating crime rate reports from 2014-2016 and employing models such as ARIMA and SARIMA with standardization, the system offers users nuanced and accurate predictions. The dashboard also enables comparative analysis against actual reported data within the specified timeframe, along with an interactive map for filtering and selecting Airbnb options based on various criteria.
											<li>Developed an interactive dashboard facilitating the selection of Airbnb accommodations within NYC, forecasting future crime rates for up to 30 days in advance based on price, borough, review rating, host identity and instant bookability</li>
											<li>Created a comparative analysis against actual reported data within the specified timeframe</li>
											<li>Compared accuracies of ARIMA and SARIMA model types with standardization for optimal performance</li>
